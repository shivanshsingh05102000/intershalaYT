## For Evaluators

- **Setup** — see [Setup](#setup) below; takes under 5 minutes with `npm run seed`.
- **Features** — see [Feature Checklist](#feature-checklist) and [API Endpoints](#api-endpoints).
- **Usage** — see [Usage Walkthrough](#usage-walkthrough) for a step-by-step
  path through every graded feature (auth, search/filter, video player,
  like/dislike, comment CRUD, channel CRUD).
- **Sample data** — `npm run seed` populates 8 users, 8 channels, ~37 videos
  across all 6 categories, and generated comments. See [Sample Logins](#sample-logins).

## Setup

### Backend

```bash
cd server
npm install
copy .env.example .env
```

Edit `server/.env`:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/ytclone
JWT_SECRET=replace_with_a_long_random_string
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d
CLIENT_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173
```

Seed the database and start the API:

```bash
npm run seed
npm run dev
```

The API runs at `http://localhost:5000/api`.

### Frontend

```bash
cd client
npm install
copy .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

The frontend runs at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Usage Walkthrough

A quick path through every feature, useful for grading or a first-time look:

1. **Browse without an account** — open `http://localhost:5173`. The home page
   loads the video grid immediately; no login required to watch videos,
   read comments, search by title, or filter by category.
2. **Search & filter** — type into the header search bar (filters the grid
   live by title) or click a category button / sidebar item (Web
   Development, JavaScript, Data Structures, Music, Gaming, Education).
   Click "All" or "Home" to clear the filter.
3. **Sign in** — click **Sign in** (top right). Use one of the seeded
   accounts below, or register a new account — registration redirects you
   to the login page automatically on success.
4. **Confirm you're logged in** — your username now appears next to your
   avatar in the header. Click it to open the dropdown (your channel link,
   sign out).
5. **Watch a video & interact** — click any thumbnail. On the video page you
   can like/dislike (toggles, mutually exclusive), and add/edit/delete your
   own comments. Comments from other seeded users are visible but not
   editable by you — only the comment's author can edit/delete it.
6. **Create your channel** — click your avatar → **Your channel**. If you
   don't have one yet, you'll see a create-channel form (name + handle).
7. **Upload, edit, delete a video** — from your channel page, click
   **+ Upload Video**. Fill in title, description, thumbnail URL, video URL,
   and category, then submit — you're redirected to the new video's page.
   Back on your channel, each of your videos has **Edit** and **Delete**
   buttons (only visible to you, the owner).
8. **Log out** — avatar dropdown → **Sign out**. The header reverts to the
   Sign in button, and write actions (upload, like, comment) become
   unavailable until you log back in.

## Sample Logins

All seeded users use `password123`.

## Notes

- Video files are stored as URLs, not uploaded files.
- Nested comments are intentionally excluded, matching the assignment brief.
- The channel page supports video create, read, update, and delete workflows.
- Use `npm run seed` before evaluation so MongoDB has users, channels, videos, and comments.
